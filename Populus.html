							<p>Populus was a startup by fellow mates at my university. The idea behind the app is to have a sports fantasy app but it is centralized for all sports into a single application. </p>
							<p>My role as a part of the team was to optimize and icnrease the functionality of the application. During my time, I was able to successfully redesigned the Full Stack Architecture, resulting in a 30% improvement in app performance and scalability. I collaborated closely with front-end engineers to meet and enhance necessary design requirements, ensuring a seamless user experience. Additionally, I expanded networking opportunities, which contributed to a 15% boost in user connectivity within the app. By removing redundant API calls in the framework, I achieved faster backend responses and implementations, further enhancing the overall efficiency of the application.</p>
